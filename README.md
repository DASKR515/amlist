# ![AMLIST Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DASKR515/amlist/main/logo.jpg) AMLIST

**AMLIST** is an open-source TUI tool to manage and synchronize your anime and manga lists from [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net) and other sources using [Consumet](https://github.com/consumet).

It provides clean terminal UI with **green theme** and **white logo**, allowing multi-source fetching for **anime** and **manga**.

> **Note:** Each module is completely separate. The main command `amlist` is minimal and only supports removal (`-r`). Use `anime.js` or `manga.js` directly to access the full features.
